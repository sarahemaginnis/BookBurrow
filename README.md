# Book Burrow
A social reading site for readers, writers, and book recommendations. Find your fandom, find your friends.

## About The Project
I am a book lover and a book nerd. I spend most of my free time reading books, writing books, and engaging with the bookish community on social media. It can be frustrating and a time suck to browse and search through more generalized social media, such as Instagram, Twitter, and Tiktok, in order to find the bookish subcommunities on those apps (Bookstagram and Booktok, for example). I created Book Burrow, a completely responsive app, to help people find community and share books that they love in a fully-featured alternative to the countless apps that book lovers currently juggle (Goodreads, StoryGraph, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Tumblr, etc.).

Book Burrow allows users to engage with and create community around books and other users. 

To engage with books, users can search through a catalog of books, looking for their favorites or their next favorite read. A user can shelve books, marking them as To Be Read, Currently Reading, Read, or Did Not Finish. Users can rate books. Users can create social posts, tagging books in their posts so that their posts are displayed in a timeline feed underneath their favorite books on an individual book page.

To engage with other users, users can search through a catalog of users and posts, looking for other users who share their interests or users who they might already know. A user can follow another user, displaying the followed user's posts in a timeline feed on their homepage.
